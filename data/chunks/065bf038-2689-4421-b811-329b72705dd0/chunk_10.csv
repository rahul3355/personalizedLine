{
  ""person"": {
    ""name"": ""Ryan Washington"",
    ""info"": [""With 20+ years of experience, Ryan harnesses imagination and curiosity to strengthen relationships between people and technology."", ""Director at GMR CENTER LTD""]
  },
  ""company"": {
    ""name"": ""GMR Productions Limited"",
    ""info"": [""Founded to formulate a sustainable synergy between blockchain technology and the gaming industry."", ""GMR Center - The nexus of gaming and blockchain.""],
    ""moat"": ""Unique integration of blockchain and gaming, and token-based economy within the metaverse""
  }
}
```

Note that I used ""GMR Productions Limited"" as the company name, despite it not being explicitly stated in the text. Based on the context and the mention of Ryan Washington as the CEO of GMR, it is reasonable to assume that ""GMR Productions Limited"" is the correct company name.","In many workplaces, persistent stress among staff can be alleviated through the steady use of music over time."
