# Homepage Pipeline Diagram - Image Generation Prompt

## Master Prompt for AI Image Generation

Create a **photorealistic whiteboard photograph** taken at a slight angle (15-20 degrees) showing a completely filled technical architecture diagram. The whiteboard should look like it's in a modern startup office with natural lighting from the side. The entire surface must be densely packed with handwritten technical diagrams in black, blue, and red dry-erase markers.

## PROMPT SUMMARY FOR IMAGE GENERATOR

Generate a photorealistic whiteboard diagram in a modern office setting. The whiteboard is completely filled with a complex technical architecture diagram for a "Hyper-Personalized Outreach Intelligence Platform." Use handwritten black, blue, and red dry-erase markers. The diagram flows from left to right showing: (1) Input layer with spreadsheet icons and "Raw Prospect Corpus", (2) A diamond-shaped validation gateway labeled "Semantic Header Mapping", (3) A large central box containing 3 parallel processing lanes with stages like "Multi-Source Intelligence Aggregator", "Neural Synthesis Pipeline", "Atomic Credit Reservation System", (4) A hexagonal merge box, and (5) Output layer showing enriched results. Include bold black arrows for main flow, blue arrows for data paths, curved arrows with 1-2 word labels pointing to technical annotations. Scatter technical jargon throughout: "O(n log n) complexity", "Byzantine fault tolerance", "150B parameter architecture", "Optimistic concurrency", "Event-sourced state". Add icons: gears, lightning bolts, brain symbols, magnifying glasses, locks, targets. Include performance metrics in corners: "100K records in 47min", "3.4x reply rate", "99.97% completion", "890% ROI". Show slight imperfections: coffee ring stain, eraser marks where text was changed, not perfectly aligned boxes. Whiteboard should be 95% filled with information, photographed at a 15-degree angle with natural office lighting from the left. Include a dry-erase marker on the bottom tray. The overall aesthetic should communicate sophisticated proprietary technology while being 80% understandable - showing clear input→process→output flow but with enough technical complexity to demonstrate engineering depth and create competitive mystery.
