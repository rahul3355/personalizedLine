When you focus on providing value through better sales outreach, you build trust faster.

## Key Strategies

1. **Focus on the reader**: Don't just talk about yourself.
2. **Use data**: Back up your claims with numbers.
3. **Keep it simple**: Complexity kills sales.

### The 80/20 Rule

Focus on the 20% of efforts that bring 80% of results. In the context of sales outreach, this means prioritizing quality over quantity.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
